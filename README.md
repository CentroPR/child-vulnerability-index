# Child Vulnerability Index

The Children Vulnerability Index is a child-targeted version of the CDC/ATSDR's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The SVI is a measure of a community’s capacity to prepare and respond to natural or anthropogenic events, which may be affected by certain social conditions, including poverty, age composition, and disability. 

In the case of children, they are dependent on the parents and community’s resilience capacity in the occurrence of a disaster. They also have specific needs and challenges that must be tended to when preparing for, in the midst of, and after a disaster. 

The CVI measures the relative vulnerability of every municipality, barrios, and census tracts in Puerto Rico in 2021. It describes the conditions of children in Puerto Rico within households, the characteristics of households with children present, and overall household characteristics.

## Repository contents: 

We include the following folders in this repository: 

* `inputs` 
* `code`
* `outputs` 

`inputs` is a folder containing files the code uses to:
- create the US Census API call to download the raw data
- map municipios, barrios, and census tracts into NMEAD Zones for the purposes of statistical testing 
    
`code` is a folder containing five jupyer notebooks with code used to:
- pull the data from the US Census API
- construct the variables used to compute the CVI 
- compute the CVI
- perform statistical hypothesis testing to compare NMEAD zones' CVIs at barrio, municipio, and census tract level
- perform exploratory data analysis and compute descriptive statistics. 
    
`outputs` is a folder that, as the code is run, is populated by the files output by the code. 

## How to run the code? 

The code contained in the folder `code/` consists of five jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`) containing code written in python. 

**Requirements:**

To succesfully run this code, you **need** to have the following packages in the python environment where the jupyter notebook are run: 

- requests
- pandas
- scipy 
- pickle 
- warnings 
- openpyxl 

You may create a local development environment using `conda` or `virtualenv` from the `requirements.txt` file.

For Conda:

* Use `conda create --name <env_name>`, where <env_name> is the name of your virtual environment. 

* Activate your new environment: `conda activate <env_name>`

* Install pip to manage python specific requirements: `conda install pip`

* Install `requirements.txt` dependencies:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you've installed the required python packages into your python environment, open the notebook titled 
`01_data_pull_from_Census_API.ipynb` inside the `code/` folder, and run the code. 

The first three notebooks have to be run in the following order:

- `01_data_pull_from_Census_API.ipynb` 
- `02_define_variables.ipynb`
- `03_compute_CVI.ipynb`

The notebooks `04_statistical_hypothesis_testing_NMEAD_zones.ipynb` and `05_descriptive_statistics_and_EDA.ipynb` can be run after the outputs have been created from the first three notebooks running in the previously prescribed sequence.

The main output of this code is three flat csv files (one corresponding to municipios, barrios, and municipios) containing the CVI for each location. 

Other outputs in the `outputs/` folder are intermediary files (pickled pandas DataFrames) used to produce the final csv file products. We save these files for further exploratory data analysis, some of which which we perform in notebook #5, `05_descriptive_statistics_and_EDA.ipynb`, to get aggregated data at NMEAD zone and island-wide level.

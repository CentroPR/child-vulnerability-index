# Child Vulnerability Index

[INTRO]

## Repository contents: 

We include the following folders in this repository: 

* `inputs` 
* `code`
* `outputs` 

`inputs` is a folder containing files the code uses to:
- create the US Census API call to download the raw data
- map municipios, barrios, and census tracts into NMEAD Zones for the purposes of statistical testing 
    
`code` is a folder containing four jupyer notebooks with code used to:
- pull the data from the US Census API
- construct the variables used to compute the CVI 
- compute the CVI
- perform statistical hypothesis testing to compare NMEAD zones' CVIs at barrio, municipio, and census tract level. 
    
`outputs` is an empty folder that, as the code is run, is populated by the files output by the code. 

## How to run the code? 

The code contained in the folder `code/` consists of four jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`) containing code written in python. 

**Requirements:**

To succesfully run this code, you **need** to have the following packages in the python environment where the jupyter notebook are run: 

- requests
- pandas
- scipy 
- pickle 
- warnings 

Once you've installed the required python packages into your python environment, open the notebook titled 
`01_data_pull_from_Census_API.ipynb` inside the `code/` folder, and run the code. 

The notebooks have to be run in the following order:

- `01_data_pull_from_Census_API.ipynb` 
- `02_define_variables.ipynb`
- `03_compute_CVI.ipynb`
- `04_statistical_hypothesis_testing_NMEAD_zones.ipynb` 

The main output of this code is three flat csv files (one corresponding to municipios, barrios, and municipios) containing the CVI for each location. 

Other outputs in the `outputs/` folder are intermediary files (pickled pandas DataFrames) used to produce the final csv file products.

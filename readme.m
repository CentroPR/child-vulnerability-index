# Child Vulnerability Index

[INTRO]

## Repository contents: 

We include the following folders in this repository: 

* `inputs` 
* `code`
* `outputs` 

`inputs` is a folder containing files the code uses to:
    (1) create the US Census API call to download the raw data
    (2) map municipios, barrios, and census tracts into NMEAD Zones for the purposes of statistical testing 
    
`code` is a folder containing four jupyer notebooks with code used to:
    (1) pull the data from the US Census API
    (2) construct the variables used to compute the CVI 
    (3) compute the CVI
    (4) perform statistical hypothesis testing to compare NMEAD zones' CVIs at barrio, municipio, and census tract level. 
    
`outputs` is an empty folder that, as the code is run, is populated by the files output by the code. 

## Requirements 

To succesfully run this code, you **need** to have the following packages in the python environment where the jupyter notebook are run: 

- requests
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy 
- matplotlib
- pickle 
- pingouin (used to run statistical hypothesis tests) 
- warnings
